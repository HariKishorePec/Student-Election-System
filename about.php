<h1>Student Election System </h1>
<div class="content">
	Student Election System is a online election system, which can be used for normal class election processes. For example, election of a 
	class Representative, Student secretary, and other posts. 
	<p>When it comes to Voting by students, this platform will serve the better way. First you have to have a admin account.There can only be one admin account, and it has superuser access to database. Next, all the voters have to first register in the forum and then he/she can cast vote. One can cast only one vote, identified by user's unique ID/ student ID. </p>
	<p>So use it for your real life purposes, and have fun.</p>
	<p>Site wide look and feel can be changed in master.css</p>
	<p> Admin username and password is 'admin'.</p>
